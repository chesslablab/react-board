## ReactBlab

An easy-to-use, state-management agnostic React library of chess components as well as common chess utilities.

### Demo

Check out the [demo](https://www.chesslablab.com/) in the [React Chess](https://github.com/chesslablab/react-chess) repository.

### Install

```The state of the chessboard.
npm i @chesslablab/reactblab
```

### Usage

âœ¨ The present document is more of a tutorial with examples rather than an API description. Some familiarity with chess terms and concepts is required but if you're new to chess this document will guide you through how to easily create apps with ReactBlab components. Happy coding and learning!

#### Initialize a Classical Board

FEN stands for Forsyth-Edwards Notation and is the standard way for describing chess positions using text strings. As you can see in the following example, a FEN string representing a chess position is passed as a prop to the `ClassicalBoard` component in the `stateBoard` parameter. The `isCheck` and `flip` key-value pairs also need to be passed.

- `stateBoard` represents the state of the chessboard.
- `filterMove` allows to implement pre-processing logic for chess moves.
- `handleMove` allows to implement validation logic for chess moves.  

```js
import { ClassicalBoard } from '@chesslablab/reactblab';

function App() {
  return (
    <ClassicalBoard
      stateBoard={{
        fen: "rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQ -",
        isCheck: false,
        flip: "w",
      }}
      filterMove={() => {
        // Implement pre-processing logic for the chess move.
      }}
      handleMove={() => {
        // Implement validation logic for the chess move.
      }}
    />
  );
}

export default App;
```

ðŸŽ‰ That's it! Let's just initialize the chessboard. There is no need to implement any logic in the `filterMove` and `handleMove` functions for the sake of simplicity. For further details please check out the [demo](https://www.chesslablab.com/) in the [React Chess](https://github.com/chesslablab/react-chess) repository.

#### Initialize a Capablanca Board

In the 1920s, world chess champion Jose Raul Capablanca believed that chess would be played out in a few decades and invented a new variant. Capablanca chess incorporates two new pieces and is played on a 10Ã—8 board. The archbishop (A) combines powers of a bishop and a knight while the chancellor (C) combines powers of a rook and a knight.

A Capablanca board can be easily initialized by passing the `stateBoard` prop to the `CapablancaBoard` component. Also the `fen`, `isCheck` and `flip` key-value pairs need to be passed to the chessboard component in the `stateBoard` parameter.

- `stateBoard` represents the state of the chessboard.
- `filterMove` allows to implement pre-processing logic for chess moves.
- `handleMove` allows to implement validation logic for chess moves.

```js
import { CapablancaBoard } from '@chesslablab/reactblab';

function App() {
  return (
    <CapablancaBoard
      stateBoard={{
        fen: "r1abqkbcnr/ppppp1pppp/2n7/5p4/5P4/7N2/PPPPP1PPPP/RNABQKBC1R w KQkq -",
        isCheck: false,
        flip: "b",
      }}
      filterMove={() => {
        // Implement pre-processing logic for the chess move.
      }}
      handleMove={() => {
        // Implement validation logic for the chess move.
      }}
    />
  );
}

export default App;
```

![Figure 2](/assets/figure_02.png)

ðŸŽ‰ So this is amazing! Initializing a Capablanca board using ReactBlab components is almost the same thing as initializing a classical board. Let's just initialize the chessboard. There is no need to implement any logic in the `filterMove` and `handleMove` functions for the sake of simplicity. For further details please check out the [demo](https://www.chesslablab.com/) in the [React Chess](https://github.com/chesslablab/react-chess) repository.

#### Browse the History of SAN Moves

Have you ever attended a chess tournament? If so, you've probably noticed that each player writes down their move on a piece of paper. SAN stands for Standard Algebraic Notation. It is a human-readable text format that allows chess players to read and write chess games in Portable Game Notation (PGN) format. This example shows how the `HistoryButtons` and `SanMovesTable` components can be combined to do a specific thing: Allow browsing through the history of SAN moves.

The SAN moves table can be initialized by passing the `stateSanMovesTable` prop to the `SanMovesTable` component.

- `stateSanMovesTable` represents the state of the SAN moves table.
- `onCellClick` allows to implement on cell click logic.

The `HistoryButtons` component is initialized as described below.

- `stateHistoryButtons` represents the state of the history buttons.
- `onFastRewindClick` allows to implement on fast rewind logic.
- `onSkipPreviousClick` allows to implement on skip previous logic.
- `onSkipNextClick` allows to implement on skip next logic.
- `onFastForwardClick` allows to implement on fast forward logic.  

```js
import { HistoryButtons, SanMovesTable } from '@chesslablab/reactblab';

function App() {
  const back = 0;

  const fen = [
    "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -",
    "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3",
    "rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -",
    "rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3",
    "rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -",
    "rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/1Q6/PP2PPPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -",
  ];

  return (
    <>
      <HistoryButtons
        stateHistoryButtons={{
          back: back,
          fen: fen,
        }}
        onFastRewindClick={() => {
          // Implement on fast rewind logic.
        }}
        onSkipPreviousClick={() => {
          // Implement on skip previous logic.
        }}
        onSkipNextClick={() => {
          // Implement on skip next logic.
        }}
        onFastForwardClick={() => {
          // Implement on fast forward logic.
        }}
      />
      <SanMovesTable
        stateSanMovesTable={{
          back: back,
          fen: fen,
          movetext: "1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Qb3",
        }}
        onCellClick={() => {
          // Implement on cell click logic.
        }}
      />
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```

![Figure 3](/assets/figure_03.png)

ðŸŽ‰ Well done! This example basically displays the components. Note that no interaction is implemented in the on click functions yet. For further details check out the [demo](https://www.chesslablab.com/) in the [React Chess](https://github.com/chesslablab/react-chess) repository.

Alternatively, the `SanMovesInline` component can be used to display the chess moves in a single paragraph rather than in a scrollable table which may be more suitable for mobile devices.

```js
import { HistoryButtons, SanMovesInline } from '@chesslablab/reactblab';

function App() {
  const back = 0;

  const fen = [
    "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -",
    "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3",
    "rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -",
    "rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3",
    "rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -",
    "rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/1Q6/PP2PPPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -",
  ];

  return (
    <>
      <HistoryButtons
        stateHistoryButtons={{
          back: back,
          fen: fen,
        }}
        onFastRewindClick={() => {
          // Implement on fast rewind logic.
        }}
        onSkipPreviousClick={() => {
          // Implement on skip previous logic.
        }}
        onSkipNextClick={() => {
          // Implement on skip next logic.
        }}
        onFastForwardClick={() => {
          // Implement on fast forward logic.
        }}
      />
      <SanMovesInline
        stateSanMovesInline={{
          back: back,
          fen: fen,
          movetext: "1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Qb3",
        }}
        onSpanClick={() => {
          // Implement on cell click logic.
        }}
      />
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```

![Figure 4](/assets/figure_04.png)

With everything explained so far, let's now implement some user interactions and have them change the state. This is how to combine the `ClassicalBoard`, `HistoryButtons` and `SanMovesInline` components to allow browsing the moves of a specific opening: The Nimzo-Indian Defense.

```js
import { useState } from 'react';
import {
  ClassicalBoard,
  HistoryButtons,
  SanMovesInline
} from '@chesslablab/reactblab';

function App() {
  const [back, setBack] = useState(0);

  const fen = [
    "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -",
    "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3",
    "rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -",
    "rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3",
    "rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -",
    "rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq -",
    "rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq -",
    "rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq -",
  ];

  const movetext = "1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.Qc2";

  return (
    <>
      <HistoryButtons
        stateHistoryButtons={{
          back: back,
          fen: fen,
        }}
        onFastRewindClick={() => {
          setBack((fen.length - 1) * -1);
        }}
        onSkipPreviousClick={() => {
          setBack(prev => prev - 1);
        }}
        onSkipNextClick={() => {
          setBack(prev => prev + 1);
        }}
        onFastForwardClick={() => {
          setBack(0);
        }}
      />
      <ClassicalBoard
        stateBoard={{
          fen: fen[fen.length - 1 + back],
          isCheck: false,
          flip: "w",
        }}
      />
      <SanMovesInline
        stateSanMovesInline={{
          back: back,
          fen: fen,
          movetext: movetext,
        }}
        onSpanClick={(payload) => {
          setBack((payload.back) * -1);
        }}
      />
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```

ðŸŽ‰ Congrats! Clicking on the arrow buttons in the `HistoryButtons` component allows to go back and forward accordingly. The same thing goes if clicking on any chess move in the `SanMovesInline` component.

#### Display the Name of the Chess Opening Being Played

Also you may want to display the chess opening that is being played at a certain point in which case the `OpeningTable` component can be helpful.

- `stateOpeningTable` represents the state of the chess opening table.  

```js
import {
  HistoryButtons,
  OpeningTable,
  SanMovesTable
} from '@chesslablab/reactblab';

function App() {
  const back = 0;

  const fen = [
    "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -",
    "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3",
    "rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -",
    "rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq c3",
    "rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -",
    "rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/1Q6/PP2PPPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq -",
  ];

  const opening = {
    rows: [
      {
        eco: "E00",
        name: "Indian Defense",
        movetext: "1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Qb3",
      },
    ],
  };

  return (
    <>
      <HistoryButtons
        stateHistoryButtons={{
          back: back,
          fen: fen,
        }}
        onFastRewindClick={() => {
          // Implement on fast rewind logic.
        }}
        onSkipPreviousClick={() => {
          // Implement on skip previous logic.
        }}
        onSkipNextClick={() => {
          // Implement on skip next logic.
        }}
        onFastForwardClick={() => {
          // Implement on fast forward logic.
        }}
      />
      <SanMovesTable
        stateSanMovesTable={{
          back: back,
          fen: fen,
          movetext: "1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Qb3",
        }}
        onCellClick={() => {
          // Implement on cell click logic.
        }}
      />
      <OpeningTable
        stateOpeningTable={{
          opening: opening,
          fen: fen,
        }}
      />
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```

#### Encyclopedia of Chess Openings (ECO)

Chess openings can easily be imported into your app as an array of JavaScript objects.

```js
import { openings } from '@chesslablab/reactblab';
```

```js
[
  {
    "eco": "A00",
    "name": "Amar Gambit",
    "movetext": "1.Nh3 d5 2.g3 e5 3.f4 Bxh3 4.Bxh3 exf4"
  },
  {
    "eco": "A00",
    "name": "Amar Opening",
    "movetext": "1.Nh3"
  },
  ...
  {
    "eco": "E99",
    "name": "King's Indian Defense: Orthodox Variation, Classical System, Benko Attack",
    "movetext": "1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.Nf3 O-O 6.Be2 e5 7.O-O Nc6 8.d5 Ne7 9.Ne1 Nd7 10.f3 f5 11.g4"
  },
  {
    "eco": "E99",
    "name": "King's Indian Defense: Orthodox Variation, Classical System, Traditional Line",
    "movetext": "1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.Nf3 O-O 6.Be2 e5 7.O-O Nc6 8.d5 Ne7 9.Ne1 Nd7 10.f3 f5"
  }
];
```

#### Display Metadata About the Chess Game Being Played

Descriptive metadata or metainformation is data that describes other data. The `MovesMetadataTable` component can be used to display data about a particular game as it is shown in the following example.

```js
import {
  HistoryButtons,
  MovesMetadataTable,
  OpeningTable,
  SanMovesTable
} from '@chesslablab/reactblab';

function App() {
  const metadata = {
    "Event": "World Championship 28th",

    "White ELO":"2660",
    "Black ELO":"2785",
    "Result":"1-0",
    "ECO":"B97",
  };

  const back = 0;

#### Initialize a RAV Moves Table

Annotated games are games with comments that help understand what is going on the chessboard. They usually include variations showing the development of the game in selected positions that require an in-depth understanding. RAV stands for Recursive Annotation Variation. It is the standard format for annotated chess games. A SAN movetext is basically the same thing as a RAV movetext with the only difference that it doesn't include variations.

The `HistoryButtons` and `RavMovesTable` components can be combined to allow browsing through the history of RAV moves.

- `stateRavMovesTable` represents the state of the RAV moves table.
- `onCellClick` allows to implement on cell click logic.  

```js
import { HistoryButtons, RavMovesTable } from '@chesslablab/reactblab';

function App() {
  const back = 0;

  const filtered = "{Adapted notes, originally by J. R. Capablanca.} 1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 e6 3.c4 Nf6 4.Bg5 Be7 5.e3 Nbd7 6.Nc3 O-O 7.Rc1 c6 8.Qc2 c5 {is not a recommended move.} 9.Rd1 (9.cxd5 {would have been proper to continue.}) 9...Qa5 10.cxd5 Nxd5 11.Bxe7 Nxe7 12.Bd3 Nf6 13.O-O cxd4 14.Nxd4 (14.exd4 {was the alternative.
